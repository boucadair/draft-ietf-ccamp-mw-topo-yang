Attendees: Scott, Daniela, Jonas, Italo, Xi

Reviewed Daniela and Jonas' comments on uploaded drafts.

Decisions reached:
- Update the revision dates in all yang modules to match the submission date of the drafts to datatracker (for any draft that is dependent on iana-if-types, wait until datatracker is fixed before trying to submit).
- Informative references to internet-drafts is allowed and will not cause a delay in progressing the internet-draft through the RFC publication process.  You aren't allowed to have normative refrences to internet-drafts.  This is described here [required_content](https://authors.ietf.org/required-content)
- All imported modules need to be reflected in the normative reference section of the associated internet draft.
- Add to the informative reference section the internet-drafts that include the yang needed for the "complete" examples found in mw-topo
- Fix ascii art in mw-topo, addd ascii art to if-ref and update trees for use in "complete" examples in mw-topo.
