Notes

- Review of Action Items (https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-mw-topo-yang/issues)
-- Issues related to draft content
--- Issue #7, not manditory, Not mandatory to send to YANG Doctors, but if the group decides the draft is mature enough, send by the end of next week (4 Feb 2022) 
--- Issue #6, continue to consider instances
--- Issue #5, continue to leverage the ccamp mailing list for bandwidth and interface ref
--- Issue #3, continue bandwidth utilization discussion
--- Issue #2, tx-enable discussion
---- Used only by operators in troubleshooting (mainly on site).  So this leaf should be removed from the model because it is out-of-scope of the topology model. What is the topology model for?  Is the topology model just for exposing the topology model, or can the topology model be used for configuration?  Take to the list for further consideration.
-- New Issue Discussion
--- supporting-network is not needed in a microwave only topology model, so supporting-network is not needed in the tree in section A.1 of the draft.

-- Environment
--- Determine how to allow contributors can modify characteristics of issues (labels, assignees, etc.)

- Agenda for next two weeks is to review and decide: https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-mw-topo-yang/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A2022-02-03
