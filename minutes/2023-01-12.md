IETF 116 (Japan) Who is going:
Scott: Remote (Can present remotely if needed)
Jonas: Remote
Daniela: Not Going
Xi: May join remotely (Marco Liebsch - will attend)
Italo: TBD

Plan moving forward:
- Review Issues in all projects
- Introduction Text and alignment related to spliting up of drafts
- Examples and where they go
- Validate the examples work with yanglint
- Clean-up and review drafts
  - edit the tree files to include only the branches and leafs necessary (by hand)
  - revisions of the imports and references
  - clean up any idnits (copyright dates, boiler plate)
  - ensure the rfcstrip for yang files produces yang files that validate with pyang
  - ensure the version numbering of the yang files is correct
- Get drafts loaded on datatracker
- Request CCAMP chairs to start a last-call on all three drafts together
- Continue mailing list discussion

Notes:
- Examples:  Provide updated example in the mw-topo-yang draft that includes the use of if-ref-topo-yang and bwa-topo-yang.  Add the bwa-topo-yang and if-ref-topo-yang as an informative reference.
  - Intro text to point out the use of the other drafts to have a compelete example
- BWA:  We can use the read-only state for now (since the leaf is not mandatory) and then change to read-write later as a backward-compatible change if necessary.
- Question on the example related to geo-location information associated with the termination-point.  Put the geolocation data in the node instead of the termination-point.  The te-topology model supports adding the geolocation data to nodes.
