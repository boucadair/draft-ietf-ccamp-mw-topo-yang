Notes

- Review of Action Items (https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-mw-topo-yang/issues)
- RFC 8561 errata, submitted as an editorial but the reviewers couldn't verify that the change was editoral.  Our response should be: "The change requested is to a representative example not to any normative part of the document.  The change does not impact the technical content of the document.  Therefore the authors feel this is an editorial change.".  Amy will reply to the email about the errata.
