Notes

- Review of Action Items (https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-mw-topo-yang/issues)
- RFC 8561 errata, submitted as an editorial but the reviewers couldn't verify that the change was editoral.  Our response should be: "The change requested is to a representative example not to any normative part of the document.  The change does not impact the technical content of the document.  Therefore the authors feel this is an editorial change."
