Attendees: Scott, Jonas, Daniela, Danilo, Italo, Xi

Agenda:
Reviewed last call comments on mw-topo from Italo

Discussed issue with units: kbps
Changing to "kilobits/second" would be more clear.  However,
it was suggested to align with other IETF drafts and use "bits/second".
This information was confirmed by Daniela in an email after the meeting concluded

Network Topologies supporting multiple-layers
Italo brought forth a discuss that has been ongoing in the flexi-grid work.  There is no way currently in the model to identify that node is a "microwave node" and no way to identify a link a being a "microwave link".  This is a deficiency in the topology work that is being augmented.  There is no guidance on how to handle this situation.  So a suggestion is shown below.

Add a presence container to indicate if the node is a microwave node.  And add a presence container to indicate a link is a microwave link.

Below is an example that includes the original text and the modified text with a suggested remedy.  Notice the name change of mw-link-choice to mw-link.

        container mw-link-choice {
          description "Specification of type of link.";
          choice mw-link-option {
            description "Selection of type of link.";
            case microwave-radio-link {
              container "microwave-radio-link" {
                presence
                  "Denotes a microwave radio link";
                uses microwave-radio-link-attributes;
                description
                  "Denotes and describes a microwave radio link";
              }
            }
			case microwave-carrier {
              container "microwave-carrier" {
                presence "Denotes a microwave carrier";
                uses microwave-carrier-attributes;
                description "Denotes and describes a microwave carrier";
              }
            }
		}

	
	    container mw-link {
		  presence "This is a microwave link";
          description "Specification of type of link.";
          choice mw-link-option {
		    mandatory true;
            description "Selection of type of link.";
            case microwave-radio-link {
              container "microwave-radio-link" {
                presence
                  "Denotes a microwave radio link";
                uses microwave-radio-link-attributes;
                description
                  "Denotes and describes a microwave radio link";
              }
            }
			case microwave-carrier {
              container "microwave-carrier" {
                presence "Denotes a microwave carrier";
                uses microwave-carrier-attributes;
                description "Denotes and describes a microwave carrier";
              }
            }
		}

Continue to monitor the CCAMP list for other guidance on the topic.

Current plan is to not update the existing draft further before IETF 117, but to create an update of the yang so that the remedy can be review by others in CCAMP.
The group discussed that the changes are not major enough to warrent another last-call, but that will be discussed with the CCAMP chairs at IETF 117.

For the 8561bis document, do not submit a 00 draft yet.
