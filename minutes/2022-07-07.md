The current plan is to generate a new microwave-topology draft that includes the mode changes (using choice) from Italo.  The new draft will be circulated prior to posting on 11 JUly (which is the document deadline for IETF 114).

The rfc8561bis initial individual draft can be created and submitted on 11 July as well, if there is concensus on email between the interested authors.  If the email thread concludes that we are not ready to submit an rfc8561bis, then I will add a slide to the microwave-topology status presentation to indicate there is interest in creating an update to rfc8561.

I will request a slot for the microwave-topology draft during the ccamp session at IETF 114.  We can probably cover both topology and a new rfc8561bis in the same slot.

On the next meeting which is 14 July, we can review the status presentation slides.

Next Meeting: 14 July 2022 at 1100 CEST
