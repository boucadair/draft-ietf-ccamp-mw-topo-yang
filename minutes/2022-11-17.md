Walk through of remaining issues
Issue #2 Support for tx-enabled or not?
- For future release - Not to be included in 1st release
Issue #3 Bandwidth utilization
- Same topic as issue #6 Maximum Link/Carrier Utilization % for draft-ybam-rfc8561bis raised in ETSI discussions
- Same outstanding questions to be resolved - Measurement interval and if/what to relate percentage to
- Suggested to be brought back to ETSI for further clarification/discussion
- Not a showstopper for a 1st release of the topology model. Can be added later as a bis version of a separate module with augmentation
Issue #5 Request & consider feedback from CCAMP on the suggestion to include generic modules for bandwidth & interface ref
- Send mail to CCAMP mailing list about creating separate modules for bandwith availability and interface references
- Suggest to be put into a separate draft in order not to tie them specifically to microwave by as in the case of including them in the microwave topology draft
Issue #11 Operational Mode
- Most likely a larger work item, not expected to be included of a 1st release of the microwave topology 

Continued work to focus on editorial updates
- Break out generic modules into a separate draft
- Finalize content, text, examples, references, etc. in the two drafts
