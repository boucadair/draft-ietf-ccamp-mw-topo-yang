Attendees Scott, Jonas, Amy, Leo, Daniela

Notes: 
The plugtest can use the current model without the enhancement to mode.  There is no urgency to get the model updated to support the plugtest.

Discussion continues on Band & Carrier Aggregaton in the [issue #2 rfc8561bis] (https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis/issues/2)

Jonas to provide an alternative example to issue #2 above and create a new issue in the rfc8561bis github if necessary.

Next Meeting: 16 June 2022 at Noon CEST
