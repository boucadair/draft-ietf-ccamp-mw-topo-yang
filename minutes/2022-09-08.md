Discussion on how to progress the mw-topo-yang draft.  In order to progress faster with no draft dependencies, make the changes to the types directly in the mw-topo-yang module for now.
Created new issue [#23](https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-mw-topo-yang/issues/23)
Continue the discussion of the issue which needs resolution before a last call is made [#3 - Bandwidth utilization](https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-mw-topo-yang/issues/3)

Progress the Band and Carrier Aggregation topic, but consider making this a follow-on bis or RFC that augments the mw-topo-yang and radio link yang.

Continue to discuss/progress the individual draft [draft-ybam-rfc8561bis](https://github.com/samans/draft-ybam-rfc8561bis)
